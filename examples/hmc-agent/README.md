# AI agent to manage Power Infra using MCP Server built for HMC

This is a reference application built for PIM stack using MCP server leveraging HMC APIs.
this wraps HMC server and agent on top of [vLLM server](../../examples/vllm) built.

It bootstraps HMC server and HMC agent components. Steps to build and containerize are [here](app)

## Configuration

Since vLLM AI image can be used as a base for many LLM inferencing applications like chatbot, entity extraction and many more.  Below provided configurations tune the vLLM engine as per the HMC Agent AI use case.

This can be fed into the application via `config-json` explained [here](../../docs/configuration-guide.md#ai)

#### llmImage
vLLM container image built using app section [here](../vllm/app)
#### llmArgs
Args you can pass it to your vLLM inference engine like model name, maximum model length etc. model name passed as part of llmArgs will be used by HMC agent.  
**Make sure to pass tooling related configuration as part of llmArgs as captured in the sample config**
#### llmEnv
Environment variables that you intend to set while running vLLM inference engine
#### hmcConfig
HMC credential details like ip address, username and password used by HMC server to authenticate with HMC

**Sample config:**
```ini
config-json = """
  {
    "llmImage": "quay.io/<account id>/pim:vllm-app",
    "llmArgs": "--model ibm-granite/granite-3.2-8b-instruct --max-model-len=26208 --enable-auto-tool-choice --tool-call-parser granite",
    "llmEnv": "OMP_NUM_THREADS=16",
    "hmcConfig": "HMC_IP=9.100.9.90, HMC_USERNAME=hmcuser, HMC_PASSWORD=lab123",
  }
  """
```

## Steps to build PIM HMC agent image
Pre-requisite: Since PIM HMC agent image bootstraps HMC server and HMC agent, build the respective container images and push them to container registry by following steps [here](./app)

- Enter into hmc-agent example application directory containing [Containerfile](./Containerfile)
- Build the PIM HMC agent container image using podman
```
podman build -f Containerfile -t <your registry>/pim:hmc-agent
```
- Push the PIM HMC agent container image to container registry
```
podman push <your registry>/pim:hmc-agent
```

**NOTE: While deploying HMC agent application, use the `<your registry>/pim:hmc-agent` image built above as the image parameter in [config](../../config.ini)**
